- Last tested 1.20.60
- This behavior pack replaces blocks in the second hot-bar slot, with the block located in the first hot-bar slot
- ***Give player "paint" tag to activate**
- Changes in v0.0.6:
  - Renamed manifest file to fix bug loading on some OS
- Use items below for different distribution methods. Each have different pros/cons. So try each:
  - splash_potion: replaces a 5x5 cube around the player
  - squid_spawn_egg: replaces a 5x5 cube around the block the egg was used on
  - snowball: replaces a 5x5 cube around the block the snowball hits when thrown
  - brush: replaces only the block the brush was used on
- Water buckets, lava buckets, and powder snow buckets replace/replace-with those block types respectively. Empty buckets replace/replace-with air
